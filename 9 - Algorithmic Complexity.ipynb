    "Now that we have a more abstract way to think about the meaning of time, we turn to the question of dependence on the value of the input. We del with that by moving away from expressing time complexity as a single number and instead relating it to the sizes of the inputs. This allows us to compare the efficiency of two algorithms by talking about about how the tunrning time of each grows with respect to the sizes of the inputs.\n",

The worst-case provides and UPPER BOUND on the running time. This is critical in situations where there is a time constraint on how long a computation can take. It is not good enough to know that \"most of the time\" the air traffic control system warns of impending collisions before they occur.\n",
